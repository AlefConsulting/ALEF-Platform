Why we decided to open a source code?
Complicated software complicated to sell. We found, that most of income goes from the making solution on this platform. Platform itself it is hard to sell. Moreover, Solution it is hard to sell as well, because there is no two congruent clients. Each client is different. We would like to focuse on a Project development.

We are going to publish on GitHub source codes of following projects:
Eng_6.1_Win32 client - Win32 Client of Designer and RunTime in one application
Eng_Silverlight client - Silverlight runtime client
Eng HTML5 client - HTML5 runtime client
PDMS - .Net sources for the Solution, which allow to build original Product Data Management System.... for your company.
FMS - .Net sources for Solution, which allow to build Financial Management System.... 
BMS - .Net sources for Solution, which allow to build Budget Management System...
PDP - .Net sources for Solution, which allow to build Data Scrapper System, which collects data from Internet and provide verification of collected quantitative data..
